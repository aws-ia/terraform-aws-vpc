#Â VPC module - Example: AWS Cloud WAN connectivity

This example shows how you can use this module with `core_network` subnets, and AWS Cloud WAN's VPC attachment. This examples creates the following:

* Global Network and Core Network.
* Core Network's policy (in `cwan_policy.tf`), creating two segments (prod and nonprod) in two AWS Regions (*us-east-1* and *eu-west-1*). The *prod* segments needs acceptance for the attachments.
* The VPC module creates the following (in two AWS Regions):
  * Two sets of subnets (workloads and core_network)
  * Cloud WAN's VPC attachment - with attachment acceptance for the VPC to associate to the *prod* segment.
  * Routing to Core Network (0.0.0.0/0 & ::/0) in workload subnets.
