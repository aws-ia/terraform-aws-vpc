# Create VPC flow logs

This example builds a VPC with public and private subnets in 3 availability zones, creates a nat gateway in each AZ and appropriately routes from each private to the nat gateway. It creates an internet gateway and appropriately routes subnet traffic from "0.0.0.0/0" to the IGW. It creates encrypted VPC Flow Logs that are sent to cloud-watch and retained for 180 days.

At this point, only cloud-watch logs are support, pending: https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-vpc/issues/35
