# Deploy VPC subnets to a specific set of Availability Zones

This example shows how you can use this module to deploy a VPC defining a list of specific Availability Zones where subnets should be deployed. This example creates the following:

* VPC with IPv4 CIDR block named "specific-azs"
* Private subnets deployed in each of the Availability Zones defined in the input variable `azs` with the name prefix "vpc-specific-azs-private" and a /18 netmask
