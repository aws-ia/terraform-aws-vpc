# NAT Gateway Options

This example builds a VPC with public and private subnets in 2 availability zones.
It creates NAT GW in public subnet with either "none", "single_az" or "all_azs" option.
It creates routes from private subnets to NAT GW if `connect_to_public_natgw` is true otherwise no route is created.
It creates an internet gateway and appropriately routes subnet traffic from "0.0.0.0/0" to the IGW.
